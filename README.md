  ## Description

  This project was to build a social media API using noSQL, MongoDB, and Mongoose that could be used to create, read, update, and delete data from a database.

  ## Installation

  Run "npm install" from the root directory.
  
  ## Usage
  You can use the database locally with MongoDB from the terminal. As long as MongoDB is installed and running on your computer, simply start the server with "npm start" and you'll be up and running.
